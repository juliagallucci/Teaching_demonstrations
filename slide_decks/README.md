This folder contains the slide decks prepared for the Assistant Professor (Teaching Stream) on-campus interview at the University of Toronto Faculty of Information.

Each slide deck is designed as a mini-demonstration aligned with the learning objectives of the iSchool’s Human-Centred Data Science curriculum.


1. Clustering Demonstration

Topic: Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Clustering
Course Context: INF2190 – Introduction to Data Analytics
Overview:
This lesson introduces students to unsupervised learning through the K-Means algorithm.
Using the Palmer Penguins dataset, students explore how clustering can be used to identify natural groupings in  data after scaling and evaluating model performance using the elbow method.
Key Concepts: feature scaling, inertia/WSSD, iterative cluster updates, random state reproducibility.

2. Simple Linear Regression & Correlation Demonstration

Topic: Supervised Learning with Simple Linear Regression
Course Context: INF1344 – Introduction to Statistics for Data Science
Overview:
This lesson builds on descriptive statistics to introduce predictive modeling using linear regression.
Using the Sacramento Real Estate dataset, students learn to interpret the regression equation, visualize model fit, and evaluate performance using R-squared and RMSE.
Key Concepts: correlation, slope and intercept interpretation, coefficient of determination, residual error.
