## Teaching Demonstration Materials

Julia Gallucci, PhD Candidate – Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto
Assistant Professor (Teaching Stream), Human-Centred Data Science — Faculty of Information

This repository contains all materials prepared for the teaching demonstrations presented as part of the Assistant Professor (Teaching Stream) on-campus interview at the University of Toronto Faculty of Information (iSchool).
Each component is designed to illustrate a concept-to-code teaching philosophy, emphasizing clarity, reproducibility, and accessibility in data science education. The materials integrate both theoretical grounding and applied coding examples to align with the iSchool’s Human-Centred Data Science curriculum.


### Folder Structure
1. **slide_decks**
Contains the presentation slides for both teaching demonstrations.
Each deck includes theoretical explanations, visual aids, and annotated code walkthroughs.

2. **coding_demos**
Includes the fully annotated code used during each demonstration. Notebooks are more descriptive than what is presented in slides and are designed for hands-on student engagement and reproducible workflows.

3. **datasets**
Contains the datasets used in both demonstrations.
These are open-source and selected for clarity, interpretability, and relevance to real-world data science contexts.
