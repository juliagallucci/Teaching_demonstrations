This folder contains the datasets used in the teaching demonstrations for the Faculty of Information teaching presentations.

1. Clustering Demonstration

Dataset: Palmer Penguins
Purpose: Used to introduce unsupervised learning concepts through K-means clustering.
Description: The dataset includes measurements (e.g., bill length, flipper length) for penguins from species collected in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. 
It provides a clear example for exploring how clustering algorithms identify natural groupings in data.

2. Simple Linear Regression and Correlation Demonstration

Dataset: Sacramento Real Estate
Purpose: Used to demonstrate supervised learning with simple linear regression and to illustrate the relationship between two quantitative variables (house size and sale price).
Description: This dataset includes information on homes sold in Sacramento, California, such as square footage, and sale price.
